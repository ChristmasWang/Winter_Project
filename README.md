# Winter_Project
This is for NJU CS2019 Winter_Project. :smirk:

### For the First week(ddl: 2020.1.19 20:00), you have to  do these.
1. Finish exercise/exercise.cpp (Note: `MergeSort` and `QuickSort` are not required.)
2. Answer the Questions in exercise/exercise.cpp (Write down U answer in .cpp)
3. Think about the Project. (What/How to do? `Make a PowerPoint and Show it to ME`)

### Before the next weekï¼Œ you may have to learn something.
1. What is `Class`? And what is the difference between `class` and `struct`.
2. If you want to program a GUI intereface for your project (not just in cmd), you may have to learn something about **QT**.
